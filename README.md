README
======

This is the source for what I'm writing up on my website:
<https://thomasnyberg.com>

This is my own extremely stripped down home-grown static site generator. On
debian/Ubuntu the necessary packages are `markdown` and `make`. I'd recommend
you use a real site generator, but if you're weird like me, feel free to use
this.
